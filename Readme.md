# Tomato Timer

This timer is a HTML5 utility to follow the [pomodoro
technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), a productivity
technique. It tries to facilitate getting into a flow state by dividing the work
flow into intervals of work and pauses with fixed durations.

This timer allows the user to be track the remaining time in each interval. The
timer uses notifications to alert the user of the end of the current interval,
clicking on the notification automatically starts the next interval. The timer
automatically cycles between the intervals: work (25min), short break (5min),
work, short break, work, short break, work, long break (15min).

This web app is offline enabled.
